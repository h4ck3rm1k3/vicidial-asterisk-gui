################ UPGRADE

NOTE: Upgrading from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3 is below the first section
NOTE: Upgrading from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2 is in the middle section
NOTE: Upgrading from 1.1.12-3 to 2.0.1 is at the bottom

########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.3 TO 2.0.4 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.4.sql
	quit

3. add the "server_reports" directory to your Web Path:
	mkdir $PATHweb/vicidial/server_reports/
	chmod 0777 $PATHweb/vicidial/server_reports/

4. A new set of changes have been made to the statuses sections in the admin.php
	pages allowing for categorizing statues and modifyig them without delete.
	Also, the gathering of a tally of the statuses in these categories is 
	now available on the timeonVDADall scripts.

5. The admin.php interface has had more sections broken into sub-sections for
	easier management and rapid modifications.

6. Added option for shorter enter and leave sounds(done during Asterisk build)
	BASE/SCRATCH_INSTALL or extras/Changed_meetme_sounds for more details




########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.2 TO 2.0.3 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.3.sql
	quit

3. The server_stats.php has been merged into the vicidial/admin.php page

4. Width of the admin.php screen, and the color and size of the headers are all
	now definable by variables at top of the admin.php script.

5. Dial Override checkbox added to the campaign modification screen of admin.php
	to force manual dial_level changes in ADAPT dialing modes.

6. Behaviour of HotKeys in manual dial mode has changed to automatically go on 
	to the next lead when a HotKey is pressed.

7. It is now possible for agents to dial alternate phone numbers using only
	HotKeys if ALTPH2 and/or ADDR3 are added to a campaign's hotkeys.

8. You can now use BLEND/INBND/*_C/*_B/*_I to define a campaign a a CLOSER 
	campaign capable of taking inbound calls.

9. In Auto-dialing campaigns(RATIO and ADAPT) you can now configure the dialer 
	to dial up to two alternate numbers per lead automatically, as well as 
	defining the statuses that you want to do this for. More info about
	this feature in the ALTERNATE_NUMBER_DIALING.txt doc.

10. Added ability to send multiple concurrent transfers at once to agents in 
	outbound campaigns. This will greatly benefit larger VICIDIAL 
	installations by decreasing the time it takes for a call to get	to an 
	agent once answered after a large queue backup. This is defaulted to 
	AUTO, but can be forced to a set number. This is the Concurrent 
	Transfers option in the Campaign Modification page.

11. New optimized code for AST_manager_send.pl and AST_send_action_child.pl. 
	Thanks to Lott Caskey for the code contribution

12. The field user_group has been added to several log tables to allow for 
	better tracking of stats by user groups. Several reports now offer 
	user group display options.

13. VERY IMPORTANT!!! Make sure the php.ini setting for memory_limit is set to 
	a minimum of 12M, we recommend 48M:
		memory_limit = 48M
	Some of the scripts have grown in size and need more memory to run
	properly on some systems.

14. Added ability to control access to each admin section by vicidial_users.
	This includes a view_reports settings to restrict access to all of the
	reports scripts.

15. Added Agent Pause Codes that are definable per campaign and allows the
	agent to select what they are doing when they are in pause time.

16. Added optional Asterisk-compatible queue_log logging for QueueMetrics
	compatibility. See the QUEUEMETRICS.txt doc for more information

17. RECOMMENDATION - If you are calling in the USA, you should add the 
	"--postal-code-gmt" flag to your adjust GMT script in the crontab to
	more accurately assign timezones to your leads.

18. Changed dial statuses to use dynamic number of dial statuses instead of
	static dial_status_x fields.

19. Added Mute/UnMute ability to vicidial.php agent screen. To use, you must
	have the _X18600XXX and _X28600XXX entries in your extensions.conf

20. Added basic sipsak display on compatible SIP devices for VICIDIAL activity.

21. Tested with Asterisk 1.2.16 and 1.2.17, new patch for meetme volume controls
	for those two versions, see SCRATCH_INSTALL for more info.

22. Added HOME link to the admin web page that goes to a configurable web address.






########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.1 TO 2.0.2 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

	/etc/astguiclient.conf has new variables for new functionality including:
	- new ADMIN_keepalive_ALL process settings
	- FastAGI_log server settings
	and comments are added to the astguiclient.conf file

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.2.sql
	quit
	/usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_area_code_populate.pl
		The Daylight Savings Time scheme for the USA and Canada has been
		updated for the 2007 changes. Also, Brazil DST has been added.
		Another addition on this topic is the addition of USA zipcode
		GMT offset list that allows for more accurate timezone lookups.

3. The astguiclient web directory has been removed and the 
	astguiclient/admin.php functions have been merged into the 
	vicidial/admin.php page

4. You can now define trunks for use only by specific campaigns. See the help
	in the vicidial/admin.php server modification page under the 
	VICIDIAL SERVER TRUNKS section.

5. Agents now have the ability to control volume levels for any call in their 
	meetme room directly from the vicidial.php page. This only works on 
	Asterisk 1.2.7.1, 1.2.12.1, 1.2.13 or SVN_1.2 and the meetmeadmin_volume_control.patch
	patch must be applied as described in the SCRATCH_INSTALL. Also, a few 
	lines must be added to the extensions.conf for this to work:
	(_X48600XXX, _X38600XXX, 8300 [see docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample])

6. Multiple ADMIN_keepalive scripts have been replaced with a single script
	ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl
	Remove all other ADMIN keepalive entries in your crontab and replace
	with this one:
	### keepalive script for astguiclient processes
	* * * * * /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl

	NOTE: the scripts to be kept alive are to be defined in the astguiclient.conf file

7. FastAGI replacement for call_log and VD_hangup AGI scripts:
	FastAGI_log.pl - requires cpan module Net::Server to run
	If you want to use it, read the comments at the top of the script
	Look at the docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample file for examples
	of how to use this new feature in your dialplan
	- cpan
	- install Net::Server

8. Fix for unregistered SIP trunks (thanks to Chris Doyle):
	look at the bottom of the docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample
	file for examples of what to put in your extensions.conf file to get
	VICIDIAL auto dialing to work with non-registered SIP trunks. remember 
	to put sip-silence.gsm in your /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ directory.

9. Added new campaign summary screen and reformatted the timeonVDADall report:
	A summary screen with all of the call information for every active 
	campaign for the day. reformatted campaign Realtime report with new
	colors and other display options.

10. Added new script to change the server_ip entries when a machine changes IPs
	The ADMIN_update_server_ip.pl script can be used to update your server's
	IP address within all vicidial database tables and config files from
	this one script. This can even be run in the crontab if you are on
	a DHCP service and need to modify your IP address often

11. Added new script to allow for dial-out-only(no agents on the server) 
	VICIDIAL servers as well as balance dialing where a server with 
	available trunk lines can dial lines for another server that does not
	have enough lines to dial for it's dial_level. AST_VDauto_dial_FILL.pl
	script is only for multi-server systems and is started from new 
	ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl script with option 7 in astguiclient.conf

12. Added the ability to restrict agent logins by user group to a specific set
	of campaigns. This is definable in the USER GROUPS section of admin.php.
	You must make sure that your admin login is in a user group and that
	the selected user group has the allowable campaigns set to ALL
	CAMPAIGNS to be able to view and modify all campaigns in the system.

13. Added lead_id and user fields to the recording_log, along with cross-
	reference links in several admin web pages for these.

14. Changed Drop percentage to be out of Answered calls for FTC compliance.

15. Tested new asterisk-perl module (0.09) and found that it is NOT compatible.
	Please make sure you use asterisk-perl-0.08 ONLY.





########## UPGRADING FROM 1.1.12-3 TO 2.0.1 ##########

If you are upgrading to the 2.0 code tree from the 1.1.12-3 release there have 
been several changes made to the code base and to where some files are stored in
the release as well as on your machine.

1. upgrade the MySQL Asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.1.sql
	quit


2. use the new installer for astguiclient-VICIDIAL files:
	NOTE: this new script is interactive with prompts. this script will
	create the new /etc/astguiclient.conf settings file that replaces the
	old AST_SERVER_conf.pl file that has been removed. Also, this settings
	file is used by dbconnect.php scripts so no need to manually edit them

	perl install.pl


3. Make sure you have MySQL clientlibs installed:
Because all perl script now use DBI instead of Net::MySQL you need to make sure 
that you have at least the MySQL client installed on all VICIDIAL servers even 
if the MySQL server is installed on another machine. You can skip this step if 
MySQL server is already on your VICIDIAL server:
  Go to http://www.mysql.com/ and download the mysql package
   - to install this directly on the command line type:
	- cd /usr/local
	- wget http://mirror.trouble-free.net/mysql_mirror/Downloads/MySQL-4.0/mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- gunzip mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- tar xvf mysql-4.0.27.tar
	- cd mysql-4.0.27
	- groupadd mysql
	- useradd -g mysql mysql
	- "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --without-server --enable-shared=yes --with-readline"
	- make
	- make install
   - you are done


4. New MySQL perl modules:
You will need to make sure that you have installed the following perl modules:
DBI (top-level Database interface module "install DBI")
DBD::mysql (MySQL-specific interface through DBI "force install DBD::mysql")


5. new predictive dialing crontab entry:
If you will be using the new predictive dialing functions you need to make sure 
you have the keepalive for this function loaded in your crontab:
NOTE: this only needs to be on a single server if you are in a multiple 
VICIDIAL server setup.
### keepalive script for VICIDIAL predictive script
* * * * * /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_keepalive_AST_VDadapt.pl


6. all old crontab entries and /home/cron files 
All of your old crontab entries need to be changed from /home/cron to
/usr/share/astguiclient if you choose the default installation path. You can
manually set the path to /home/cron if you like though since the home path is
now dynamic in all vicidial perl(.pl) scripts. If you do choose to use the new
default path, you can delete everything in the /home/cron directory if you like


7. old /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries
Be sure to change your /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries(the commands that are run at
system boot to start asterisk and other scripts like log rolling) and change the
/home/cron path to the new /usr/share/astguiclient path.


8. other notes:
- there is a new DIAL METHOD field and several other new dial-control fields 
in campaign modification page, please take a minute to read the help 
documentation for these new features.
